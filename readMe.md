# How to use these files.
Run the following command from your home directory:

git clone [grab the ssh or http remote info from the project page]
example:
`git clone git@git.collemcvoy.com:pierce/dotfiles.git`

It will prompt you for your user name and password

Once the repository has been cloned to our home directory, simply change to the cm_dotfiles directory, make the makesymlinks.sh script executable, and run the script, like so:

`cd ~/dotfiles`

`chmod +x makesymlinks.sh`

`./makesymlinks.sh`

Log out and back in for the changes to take.
